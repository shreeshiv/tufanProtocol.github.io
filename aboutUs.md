5. Problems in current Eco-system

- Sometimes we lost invoices/bills
- Invoices/Bills are not organised.
- No analytics, how you spend or invest your money.

- At the end of financial year, we have to submit all invoices/bills to our accountant for compiling our statements. At that time finding all invoices and bills is very boring and time consuming process.
